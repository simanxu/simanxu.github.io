I am currently a robotics researcher at ByteDance [Seed-Robotics](https://seed.bytedance.com/zh/), where my research focuses on robotic reinforcement learning, learning based robot manipulation and locomotion, and unified control frameworks for robots. Previously, I worked as a researcher at [Tencent Robotics X](https://roboticsx.tencent.com/#/), with research interests in robot motion control and planning, high-dynamic motion planning, and real-time dynamic parameters identification for robotic systems. I hold both a bachelor’s and a master’s degree from the Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Intelligent Robots and Systems at [Beijing Institute of Technology](https://www.bit.edu.cn/), where I was supervised by Professors [Zhihong Jiang](https://pure.bit.edu.cn/en/persons/zhihong-jiang) and [Qiang Huang](https://pure.bit.edu.cn/en/persons/qiang-huang).

I am deeply passionate about robotics, with my career consistently centered on robot control and planning. During my tenure at Tencent, I concentrated on real-time control and planning grounded in dynamics and numerical optimization. At ByteDance, I have conducted in-depth research on end-to-end control methods for large-scale neural networks trained using supervised learning and reinforcement learning. My long-term ambition is to develop general-purpose embodied robots with human-like intelligence, enabling robots to seamlessly integrate into human production and daily life, and ultimately drive meaningful progress in human society.

Research Interests
======
My research focuses at the intersection of embodied intelligence and robotics, particularly the following areas:

- **Robot Manipulation:** long-horizon manipulation, dexterous manipulation, deformable manipulation, etc.
- **Robot Locomotion:** optimal control, dynamics and model-based control, RL-based legged locomotion, etc.
- **System Identification:** system modeling, online dynamic parameters identification, offline kinematics calibration, etc.
- **System Infrastructure:** control system and core algorithm, data collection and annotation system, deployment optimization, etc.
